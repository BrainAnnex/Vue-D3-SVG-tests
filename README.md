# Misc. tests/demos for Vue.js, D3.js, SVG, and the combination of Vue and D3

*CONTENTS OF TOP-LEVEL FOLDERS :*

Sharing these files is the main reasons I made this repository public.

Please see my article **[D3 Visualization with Vue.js : a powerful alliance (when done right)!](https://julianspolymathexplorations.blogspot.com/2022/01/D3-plus-Vue-visualization-UI.html)**

Sub-folders:
* D3js: tests with just D3.js (no Vue)
* SVG: SVG tests, plus some libraries.  Of particular interest is the library in **SVG_helper** (actively used with D3)
* **Vue_and_D3: tests and demos in leveraging Vue with D3**

### Vue
Simple tests, mostly from the time I was first learning Vue.

No claim of them being good code, but they might be of interest to new Vue2 learners (to whom I highly
recommend this [extended video series from "The Net Ninja"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQcYgjhBoeQH7wiAyZNrYa))

I also hugely recommend [7 Ways to Define a Component Template in Vue.js](https://vuejsdevelopers.com/2017/03/24/vue-js-component-templates/) ;
I personally like "Template literals": very readable, with no need to bother with compilation - ready to use!

### Vue2_lib
The download of the very final release of Vue2 (version 2.6.12).

A very stable, excellent version of Vue!

Fast and convenient to link to a locally-stored copy.
